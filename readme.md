# GoFlux - Current Development Status

## Project Overview

GoFlux is an event-driven microservices platform designed to provide a production-ready, language-agnostic infrastructure with real-time monitoring capabilities. The platform is built using Go for the backend services and Lit Element for the frontend dashboard.

## Current Development Status

**This project is currently a Work In Progress (WIP)**

The codebase is in its early development phase with the foundational architecture and project structure established, but core functionality is not yet implemented.

## What's Currently Implemented

- **Project Structure**: Complete directory organization following Go project conventions
- **Go Module**: Basic Go module setup with UUID dependency
- **Entry Point**: Simple main.go that generates UUIDs (placeholder implementation)
- **Architecture Design**: Comprehensive planning for microservices architecture

## What's Missing

- **Backend Services**: Core platform services (API Gateway, Event Bus, Service Registry)
- **Event Handling**: Event processing and routing logic
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery
- **Metrics Collection**: Real-time metrics gathering and storage
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Lit Element-based monitoring interface
- **Client SDKs**: Language-specific client libraries
- **Data Persistence**: Storage layer implementation
- **API Endpoints**: REST/GraphQL API definitions
- **Configuration Management**: Environment and service configuration
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: API documentation and usage examples

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24.6
- **Frontend**: Lit Element (planned)
- **Protocol**: Protocol Buffers (planned)
- **Dependencies**: Google UUID library

## Development Roadmap

The project is planned to be developed in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core platform services (Event Bus, Basic Messaging)
2. **Phase 2**: Service discovery and registry
3. **Phase 3**: Metrics collection and monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Frontend dashboard
5. **Phase 5**: Client SDKs and examples
6. **Phase 6**: Production deployment and optimization

## Getting Started

Currently, the project only contains a basic Go application that generates UUIDs. To run it:

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

## Contributing

This is an active development project. Contributions are welcome, but please note that the codebase is in early stages and subject to significant changes.

## Next Steps

The immediate development priorities are:
1. Implement the Event Bus service
2. Set up basic service communication
3. Create the service registry
4. Implement basic metrics collection
